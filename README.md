# Networking-System
This is a collaborative project build by me and my 4 friends.

## Build stats
- Graph Theory (Module Handled and Created:Graph Theory Functionalities)
- Trees and Tries (Module Handled and Created:Tree Algorithms)
- Huffman Decoding (Module Handled and Created:Huffman string and Huffman Tree)
- LinkedList (Module Handled and Created : LinkedList Implementation in OS Processes)

## Functionalities
- Setting up Router Networks with Edges
- Calculation of Routing Tables via Bellmann Ford Algorithm
- Finding the Maximal Strongly Connected Sub Network via KosaRaju Algorithm
- Vinzing's Theorem
- Huffmann Encoding and Decoding
- LinkedList Deadlock Process detection using Floyd's Algo
- Node flooding as Router Tree
